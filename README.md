# Converse Js

> Place this app in **nextcloud/apps/**

## This project is a fork from the original nextcloud-conversejs and is still under heavy development
Original Repo: https://gitlab.com/lil5/nextcloud-conversejs/

Although I strive for the Master branch may have working versions, this is still just the beginning of the project and may still have bugs.


## Building the app

The app can be built by using the provided Makefile by running:

    make

This requires the following things to be present:

- make
- which
- tar: for building the archive
- curl: used if phpunit and composer are not installed to fetch them from the web
- npm: for building and testing everything JS, only required if a package.json is placed inside the **js/** folder

The make command will install or update Composer dependencies if a composer.json is present and also **npm run build** if a package.json is present in the **js/** folder. The npm **build** script should use local paths for build systems and package managers, so people that simply want to build the app won't need to install npm libraries globally, e.g.:

**package.json**:

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "node node_modules/gulp-cli/bin/gulp.js karma",
    "prebuild": "npm install && node_modules/bower/bin/bower install && node_modules/bower/bin/bower update",
    "build": "node node_modules/gulp-cli/bin/gulp.js"
}
```

## Publish to App Store

First get an account for the [App Store](http://apps.nextcloud.com/) then run:

    make && make appstore

The archive is located in build/artifacts/appstore and can then be uploaded to the App Store.

## Running tests

You can use the provided Makefile to run all tests by using:

    make test

This will run the PHP unit and integration tests and if a package.json is present in the **js/** folder will execute **npm run test**

Of course you can also install [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/getting-started.html) and use the configurations directly:

    phpunit -c phpunit.xml

or:

    phpunit -c phpunit.integration.xml

for integration tests
